        <p>My name is Kelsey Gutschow and this is my portfolio.  Please feel free to take a look around
            and check out my recent projects. My background is not in coding. In fact it was in health
            care!  However, I felt the calling to try out coding. I needed to be creative, while also
            feeling challenged.  Now that I have learned the basics, I am ready to show off my skills! </p>

        <P> If you like what you see, then please reach out so we can collaborate on a project!
            I look forward to hearing from you!
            </p>
