# Basic-Portfolio
Homework assignment #1


Here is my attempt at the first homework!

I'm sure there were more efficient ways of coding things, especially the "Portfolio"
page, but this is the only way I could figure out how to get it work, without
pulling my hair out :)

I also had some difficulty figuring out how to adjust the width of the pages.
I set the overall width of each of the sections to the 960x that was suggested in the instructions, but I still ended up with white space on the sides and couldn't figure out how to get rid of it.

It was also tricky figuring out how to efficiently label things, since the assignment only outlined us using one #style.css page.

Overall, it was a pretty fun activity! I look forward to hearing your feedback.
